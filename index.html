            Decision-makers need to act now to halt biodiversity loss,
            and ecologists must provide them with relevant species
            interaction indicators to inform on community- and
            ecosystem-level changes. Yet, the integration of ecological
            networks into conservation is still virtually nonexistent.
            Here, we discuss challenges and opportunities related to
            uncertainty, interpretability and relevance of network
            metrics applied to conservation. We argue that existing data
            and methodologies are sufficient to generate network
            information usable for conservation, and to overcome
            existing challenges. Interaction network indicators must
            meet criteria important to decision-makers and be tied to
            specific conservation goals, which requires academics to
            better engage with practitioners. We suggest network
            robustness as an indicator for biodiversity management and
            showcase it in a workflow to inform decision-making.

            <ul>
            <li>Practitioners and scientists increasingly need
            multi-species and whole-ecosystem indicators that allow
            integrating species interaction networks into biodiversity
            conservation and management.</li>
            <li>Explicit and quantitative integration of ecological
            network indicators into conservation is still lacking due to
            challenges with network uncertainty and accessibility to
            practitioners.</li>
            <li>The resulting gap between network science and management
            leads to decisions being made without considering available
            scientific knowledge.</li>
            <li>We identify opportunities in closing this gap. Despite
            uncertainty, the field of network ecology is mature enough
            to offer quantitative insights into ecosystem responses to
            environmental changes.<br />
            </li>
            <li>Simple network metrics that fit criteria important to
            decision-makers and can be used with current data and
            models, are promising starting indicators to inform
            conservation and management.</li>

            id="can-interaction-network-knowledge-be-quantitatively-used-for-biodiversity-conservation-and-management">Can
            interaction network knowledge be quantitatively used for
            biodiversity conservation and management?</h1>
            <p>The need to shift from single-species conservation
            approaches to multi-species and whole ecosystem approaches
            has long been recognized [1,2]. Network information can
            provide a new perspective for whole ecosystem assessments in
            biodiversity conservation and management. Preserving species
            interactions can ensure long-term population persistence and
            maintain ecosystem functions and services [3,4]. Focusing on
            ecological networks as conservation targets promotes the
            stability of populations and ecosystem functions and
            minimises negative outcomes regarding species extinctions
            [5–7]. Recent reviews list specific interaction network
            metrics that decision-makers can use [8]. Implicit network
            information has already been integrated into conservation
            planning, for example through consideration of keystone
            species with disproportionate effects on their communities,
            which should facilitate the uptake of network-based
            biodiversity indicators in decision-making [2,9,10, see Box
            1].</p>
            <p>Despite the potential benefits, conservation practices
            rarely explicitly consider information derived from measures
            of the structure of ecological networks. Conservation policy
            and practice still heavily focus on single species and
            habitats. Uncertainty about network structure and responses
            to human disturbances mirrors concerns in macro-ecological
            and ecosystem models [11,12]. Additionally, identifying
            which interaction network metrics are suitable biodiversity
            indicators with clear interpretation for conservation
            remains challenging.</p>
            <p>Decision- and policy-makers must act now to bend the
            curve of extinction and accelerate ecosystem recovery
            [13,14]. Ecologists need to provide them with useful network
            and ecosystem-wide information. For instance, protected area
            planning could prioritise regions where mutualistic
            interaction partners or prey and predators overlap [15], or
            where there is high trophic diversity and redundancy,
            enhancing robustness to extinctions [16]. Moreover, since
            interaction network structure is linked to ecosystem
            functioning and ecosystem service provision, focusing on
            network metrics changes for conservation targets should
            ensure ecosystem stability and service delivery [e.g.,
            pollination, pest control, food production, 5,7,17]. Given
            the global goals to maintain ecosystem services [Goal B of
            the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, 18],
            assessing network structure stability changes should help
            managers and decision-makers prioritise areas to maintain
            ecosystem functioning and resilience [5,19].</p>
            <p>Here, we identify the major challenges and opportunities
            in incorporating interaction network information into
            biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. We
            demonstrate how simple approaches and indicators can provide
            relevant information for managers. Our focus is on
            probabilistic and binary species interaction networks, where
            nodes represent species and links represent the probability
            or presence of an interaction [20], rather than energy flow
            networks already covered by Fath et al. [8]. Additionally,
            we present a perspective where networks are used as
            biodiversity indicators and, in a forecasting context, to
            evaluate network responses to future environmental change
            scenarios and management strategies. Despite challenges
            relating to uncertainty, interpretability and relevance, we
            argue that we have sufficient scientific evidence and tools
            to apply network concepts to management and conservation in
            the face of global change. In particular, testing and
            exploring network indicators can accelerate the

            Trophic role of keystone species</h1>
            <p>Explicitly considering networks in conservation and
            decision-making (i.e. by monitoring and managing for
            network-derived properties) is not a drastic shift, as
            networks are often implicitly included in conservation
            decisions and recovery plans. The keystone species concept,
            frequently mentioned in conservation literature [e.g., 2,21]
            and highlighted by initiatives focused on rewilding and
            ecological restoration [22,23], is linked to the
            disproportionate effects some species have on their
            (trophic) networks [24, also see 25 for the diverse roles of
            species identified as keystones]. Similarly, several large
            carnivores have been associated with trophic cascades, where
            effets of predator declines propagated across food webs to
            herbivores, mesopredators, and beyond [26]. This reflects
            network consideration through species’ effects on others,
            even if network-specific properties are not explicitly
            quantified – i.e. metrics like connectance, species trophic
            level, or centrality do not explicitly enter planning or
            decision-making.</p>
            <p>Importantly, keystone species are often tied to
            quantified conservation targets. For example, prairie dogs
            (<em>Cynomys spp.</em>) are considered keystone species due
            to their important ecosystem functions and large impact
            compared to other herbivores, which are not replicated by
            other species [27,28]. The Recovery Strategy and Action Plan
            for the Black-tailed Prairie Dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) in
            Canada identifies it as a conservation priority due to its
            keystone status, crucial for the recovery of the
            Black-footed Ferret (Mustela nigripes) and serving as a
            vital food source for several other at-risk species [29].
            Conservation targets for Black-tailed Prairie Dogs in Canada
            include maintaining a minimum area of occupancy of 1,400 ha
            across 20 colonies and a minimum average population density
            of 7.5 individuals/ha by 2040, ensuring at least an 80%
            probability of population persistence over 50 years
            [29].</p>
            <p>The implicit consideration of network structure in
            conservation targets can facilitate the uptake of new
            network-based indicators by practitioners and
            decision-makers. Indeed, knowing this structure provides
            additional ways to identify which species are potential
            keystones, beyond their emblematic nature [30]. Other forms
            of network-thinking are similarly part of management
            considerations, such as spatial ecological networks planning
            [31] and ecosystem-based management [11]. Explicitly
            considering network-based indicators will complement these
            forms of network-thinking and enhance conservation
            assessments to include ecosystem-wide components.</p>
            <h1 id="challenges-opportunities">Challenges &amp;
            opportunities</h1>
            <p>The explicit integration of network information into
            management and conservation faces several challenges linked
            to uncertainties and lack of interpretability and relevance
            of network metrics for practitioners. These challenges will
            hinder making effective decisions, for example on what
            biodiversity and network-related properties need to be
            measured and monitored, what conservation targets and
            management actions should be applied, how often to
            re-evaluate decisions, etc. Hence, we can expect challenges
            at different stages of management planning and
            decision-making [e.g. 32], such as the evaluation of current
            conditions or upon decisions on possible actions
            (e.g. responsive, preventative, etc.).</p>
            <h2 id="uncertainty">Uncertainty</h2>
            <h3 id="network-structure-and-composition">Network Structure
            and Composition:</h3>
            <p>There is uncertainty in network structure, composition,
            and variation across space and time, which affects
            conservation assessments and actions [33,34]. Empirical
            studies on networks are often spatially disjointed, biased
            geographically and depending on interaction types, and
            rarely replicated [35–37]. Sampling biases can distort
            reported network patterns [38,39]. Terrestrial and
            freshwater food webs are less studied than marine ones,
            often with different research objectives [e.g., determining
            the effect of environmental factors, rather than
            investigating management-related elements such as
            sustainability, 35,40]. Such deficits of information may
            prove problematic when conservation decisions need to be
            made.</p>
            <p>Despite these challenges, existing methodologies can help
            integrate network information into conservation, while
            empirical data continue to be gathered. Networks can be
            constructed from extensive, long-term monitoring datasets to
            analyse food web structure and temporal stability [41,42].
            Building metawebs of all potential interactions in a region
            or species pool, like the pan-European terrestrial tetrapod
            metaweb [TETRA-EU, 43], provides an “upper ceiling” for
            possible interactions [44,45]. Metawebs can inform
            broad-scale assessments and have already been used to derive
            spatially explicit network properties and generate
            conservation-relevant information [46–48]. For instance,
            Albouy et al. [46] used a metaweb to examine robustness to
            extinction scenarios for marine food webs, showing higher
            robustness in coastal waters compared to open waters and
            highlighting some potential to absorb perturbations.
            Moreover, metaweb inference approaches allow us to
            circumvent the lack of available local interaction data [45]
            and, when used with probabilistic networks, to integrate
            uncertainty and variation in network structure across space
            [49]. Network properties and their uncertainties can
            therefore be measured for broad-scale assessments of
            variation in network structure, and to derive network
            indicators that can be used to inform decisions and planning
            (Boxes 2-3). As new empirical data becomes available, these
            predictions can be evaluated, refined, and become more
            informative [50]. We discuss the challenges surrounding
            their validation in our Concluding Remarks.</p>
            <h3 id="network-responses-to-environmental-change">Network
            Responses to Environmental Change:</h3>
            <p>Uncertainty exists in how networks will respond to
            environmental changes and disturbances, particularly for
            interaction rewiring and changes in interaction strength.
            Questions remain on the extent of rewiring due to species
            turnover versus prey switching and behavioural adaptation,
            and how these changes will propagate across trophic
            levels.</p>
            <p>While data gaps exist, modelling and inference can
            explore the limits of network rewiring under current or
            future conditions (Box 3). Rewiring potential is likely
            captured in existing and inferred metawebs [51], which can
            be combined with simulations to anticipate network changes.
            For instance, Dansereau et al.’s [49] approach can be
            extended to explore climate change impacts on network
            structure, given the dual uncertainty in species
            interactions and future species ranges. Moreover, network
            models (and information) do not need well-constrained or low
            uncertainty predictions before they can inform management
            decisions on interventions like species eradication,
            especially if they tend to correctly identify whether
            effects on other species will be positive or negative [52].
            Model uncertainty can also be high despite high quality data
            [52]. Regardless of its generality, this result suggests
            that the performance of a model should be monitored whenever
            new data are added. Similar trends of model change in
            performance with additional data have been reported in the
            study of species distributions [53].</p>
            <p>Approaches to include specific types of network response
            uncertainty in conservation and management have also been
            proposed. Van Kleunen et al. [54] suggested a multi-step
            framework for decision-making under uncertainty for species
            introduction into ecological networks, based on conservation
            decision theory. This framework includes: the identification
            of management objectives, the evaluation of outcomes for
            management (including multiple outcomes, evaluation of
            trade-offs, and assessment of uncertainty), and the
            improvement of future predictions through an adaptive
            management framework. Van Kleunen et al.’s [54]
            decision-making approach can be applied now, despite
            uncertainties, to guide management of species
            introductions.</p>
            <h3 id="compounding-uncertainty-in-change-types">Compounding
            Uncertainty in Change Types:</h3>
            <p>There is compounding uncertainty in the type and strength
            of change applied to a network. Climate uncertainty, for
            instance, results from uncertainty in future greenhouse
            gases emissions (i.e. emission scenario uncertainty), in
            climate processes (general circulation model uncertainty)
            and their stochasticity (model run uncertainty). For
            networks, we add uncertainty in changes resulting from
            disturbance regimes (e.g. fire, drought, pests) and in
            species distribution predictions [which can result from
            direct impacts of abiotic change, of disturbance regimes and
            of biotic changes that may be linked to network structure
            itself, 55,56]. If accounted for simultaneously, these
            uncertainties will inevitably lead to high variance in
            predicted network responses.</p>
            <p>We can estimate some uncertainty through backcasting:
            past environmental changes are used to predict changes in
            network metrics that are cross-validated against observed
            past networks. Fisheries data, for instance, allow
            reconstructing well-resolved networks over time, which can
            be related to known environmental changes [57–59] and be
            used to calibrate predictive network models, like bayesian
            networks [60]. Backcasting models, used as ex-ante scenarios
            of change, have been successfully used to simulate and
            assess the effectiveness of conservation actions on
            ecosystem services [61].</p>
            <p>Simulating scenarios of change can also help delimit the
            possible changes in network structure [Box 3, 62]. When
            combined with metrics of network change and sensitivity to
            disturbance, these projections can be used to identify
            target areas that show fragility to an array of scenarios
            and are of special concern, or that show less fragility and
            could be considered refugia. They can also highlight
            problematic or incomplete sampling. Projections will also
            serve to perform validation and assess indicator behaviour
            in an empirical setting, whether through existing data or
            backcasting exercises, which could lead to network-specific
            monitoring programs.</p>
            <h2 id="interpretability-and-relevance">Interpretability and
            relevance</h2>
            <p>Network metrics are often not intuitive or deemed
            relevant for practitioners and decision-makers. Many metrics
            are complex and may not clearly correlate with ecosystem-
            and species-level responses, particularly in applied
            contexts. For instance, omnivory and network motifs are tied
            to food web persistence and extinction risks [63,64],
            highlighting their ecological relevance. On the other hand,
            while network nestedness indicates a buffer against
            extinctions and fluctuations in mutualistic networks, this
            is less clear in antagonistic networks [7]. Connectance has
            also been tied in contrasting ways to network stability
            [e.g., higher connectance leading to increases or decreases
            of invasion success rates given invader trophic levels, 65;
            higher connectance linked to higher robustness to
            extinction, but larger extinction cascades, 66].</p>
            <p>Not all network metrics are suitable as conservation
            indicators, nor do they need to be. Several have been
            reviewed for their relevance and limitations in achieving
            conservation goals (Louise O’Connor, PhD thesis, Université
            Grenoble Alpes, 2022i; see Table 1 therein). For example,
            prioritising trophic networks with stabilising motifs when
            selecting protected areas can help achieve ecological
            resilience goalsi. This information can already be used
            towards conservation planning but it needs to be both
            accepted by and available to decision-makers and
            managers.</p>
            <p>First, metrics must meet decision-makers’ criteria. The
            ROARS (being Relevant, Objective, Available, Realistic,
            Specific) and SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable,
            Replicable, Time-bound) criteria [8; see Table 3 therein]
            focus on the decision-makers’ receptiveness to suggested
            indicators during the selection, paving a way to communicate
            network information with stakeholders and embed network
            indicators in ecological monitoring and ecosystem health
            assessments. Network indicators will then need to be
            evaluated in terms of usefulness to achieve conservation
            goals [as in O’Connor, 2022i] and decision-maker
            receptiveness [as in 8], as we move towards developing
            ecosystem management and monitoring frameworks that
            quantitatively and explicitly embed network indicators (see
            example in Box 2).</p>
            <p>Second, network ecologists have the opportunity to expand
            their focus from the development of mathematical tools,
            theory and theoretical validation to involving
            decision-makers and meeting their needs [67]. Consensus for
            conservation goals can be achieved through mixed methodology
            such as iterative and anonymous Delphi panels [see 68 for
            applications in ecology]. Engaging stakeholders in this way
            would ultimately provide valuable guidance to prioritise new
            fundamental research questions and methodological
            development. Although they do not ultimately make the
            decisions, network ecologists must be proactive in this
            process, especially given the limited time and staffing
            resources across many institutions where decisions are made.
            This process takes time and co-production effort, and needs
            to be initiated by academics who can guide and support
            practitioners in designing management strategies and making
            conservation decisions using network information. Academics
            place a strong focus on the development of tools and
            knowledge, but ensuring their adoption (particularly for
            non-academics) will require delivering them in a form that
            can instantly be used with minimal additional work [69].</p>
            <p>Finally, network ecologists can take concrete steps to
            ensure that network-based measures are perceived as relevant
            by decision-makers. Workshops and stakeholder involvement
            are essential to bridge the gap between science and practice
            [69] and can facilitate choosing appropriate metrics [8].
            Involving a wide-range of ecosystem-management players, and
            creating new opportunities to actively involve stakeholders
            in deciding how network information can be applied, will be
            key to ensure receptiveness and a speedy uptake of
            indicators for management planning and actions. Forecasting
            changes in network structure under environmental and
            management scenarios (Box 3) and linking network indicators
            to ecosystem services [17] can enhance receptiveness. This
            will provide essential information on risks, on boundaries
            of change given environmental conditions, and on the
            effectiveness of certain management actions in achieving
            conservation targets [70].</p>

            2 - Assessing the relevance of a potential network indicator
            for decision-making</h1>
            <p>Network metrics should be evaluated using criteria
            important to decision-makers to ensure their relevance as
            indicators and encourage adoption. In addition to the ROARS
            and SMART criteria, Fath et al. [8] suggest that effective
            indicators should also “<em>describ[e] directional change
            [of ecosystems], [be] easily communicable to managers and
            policy makers, [be] integrative and indicative to a known
            response to a disturbance</em>” [as per 71], and provide
            insight to ecosystem functioning and services.</p>
            <p>As an example, trophic network robustness to targeted
            extinctions meets these criteria (Table 1) and can be a
            useful indicator of ecosystem integrity and stability to
            environmental change. The structural stability of trophic
            networks is closely linked to the stability of ecosystem
            functioning [see review by 72], with trophic interactions
            considered as ecosystem functions and services (e.g.,
            top-down pest control by predators). Here we show a
            formulation of robustness derived from earlier works [73–75]
            that reflects the capacity of a network (or the ecosystem it
            represents) to withstand cascading extinctions:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">$$Robustness = 1 - \frac{no.
            secondary extinctions}{initial no. secondary
            consumers}$$</span></p>
            <p>where secondary extinctions are extinctions due to the
            loss of other species and secondary consumers are consumers
            of basal species (measured as network species richness minus
            the number of basal species).</p>
            <p>Robustness is easy to interpret (see Specific in Table 1)
            and to calculate using binary trophic networks, which are
            more commonly available and can be derived from existing
            trophic metawebs – this allows us to derive initial (even if
            coarse) estimates of robustness at large, regional and local
            scales (see references in Table 1). It also relates to
            ecological issues that have a firm place in ecosystem
            management and conservation, and resonate with
            decision-makers – numerous directives, policies and
            management frameworks focus on avoiding species extinctions
            (see examples in Table 1).</p>
            <p>Table 1 illustrates the potential of robustness as a
            network indicator and the process of detailing how it meets
            the criteria mentioned previously. Evaluating network
            metrics in this way is crucial for making them more relevant
            and acceptable to decision-makers, as it demonstrates why
            and how the indicator can be used effectively.</p>

            <p>Effective decision-making requires indicators based on
            accessible and reproducible analysis workflows that evaluate
            a range of scenarios. We demonstrate the potential of
            robustness with a workflow that uses different network
            disturbance scenarios and open-access data (Fig. 1). By
            using extreme scenarios, we can explore the boundaries of
            robustness to forecasted environmental change. The framework
            can be applied spatially to identify target areas for
            management and conservation action (Fig. 2) or to single
            networks.</p>
            <p>Workflow steps: - 1) Build local ‘reference networks’ by
            combining a regional metaweb of interactions with
            ‘reference’ local species presence/absence information
            (‘baseline’ referring to any reference period) – species
            that interact in the metaweb and are locally present, will
            appear and interact in the local network; - 2) For each
            reference network, calculate the number of secondary
            consumers (consumers of basal species) and other relevant
            network metrics (e.g., species and average trophic level,
            connectance, etc.) - 3) Build local ‘disturbed networks’, by
            combining the regional metaweb with species ranges projected
            under different scenarios; - 4) Calculate and map robustness
            and other network metrics (Fig. 2).</p>
            <p><strong>Figure 1. Workflow to calculate
            robustness.</strong> Simple network metrics like robustness
            can be incorporated into workflows to assess potential
            ecosystem fragility to scenarios of disturbance and inform
            management and decision-making at large scales. See
            supplemental information online for full workflow
            details.</p>
            <p>Our example explores the lower boundaries of pan-European
            trophic network robustness by submitting vertebrate networks
            to two extreme scenarios: worst-case climate change (CMIP5
            RCP 8.5, equivalent to CMIP6 SSP5-8.5), and failure to
            protect endangered species (IUCN levels: critically
            endangered, CR, endangered, EN, and vulnerable, VU; Fig. 2).
            Further analyses could be focused on investigating which
            species are forecasted to be lost, their roles in the
            networks and best strategies to protect these networks from
            a multispecies perspective. For instance, inspecting initial
            species richness and trophic positions of extinct species
            can help identify network- and species-level attributes that
            may be related to robustness (Fig. 2, lower panels). Antunes
            et al. [17] proposed a similar workflow to calculate
            network-provided Nature’s contributions to people. Ours
            differs from theirs in that it requires less sophisticated
            and less data-hungry methodological approaches. Together
            with the accessible automated pipeline [81], this should
            facilitate and accelerate uptake by practitioners, managers
            and decision-makers.</p>
            <p><strong>Figure 2. Robustness of European vertebrate
            networks to disturbance scenarios.</strong> Extreme
            scenarios of climate change and of species extinctions can
            be used to explore (lower) boundaries of network robustness
            and identify areas where we may expect a high number of
            cascading (secondary) extinctions and, consequently, larger
            disruptions to ecosystem functioning and services (upper
            panels). Further analyses of initial network metrics allow a
            deeper look into what may drive network robustness by
            comparing trophic information between primary and secondary
            extinctions (lower panels, here grouped by quantiles of
            robustness values). In this example, most networks are very
            robust to extinctions driven by a) climate change or b) the
            removal of endangered species listed in IUCN, but several
            networks in Northern Europe show lower robustness to
            targeted IUCN extinctions (upper panels). For networks that
            suffered secondary extinctions (where Robustness &lt; 1;
            ‘Sec.’ bands on lower panels), larger networks (higher
            initial species richness) were more robust and, as expected,
            secondarily extinct species occupied higher trophic
            positions than primarily extinct species (‘Pri.’ bands). See
            supplemental information online for more detail. Data and
            analyses for this figure were adapted from Ceres Barros, PhD
            thesis, Université Grenoble Alpes, 2017iv.</p>
            <h1 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding remarks</h1>
            <p>Ecological networks already can and should be used as
            indicators in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem
            management. Sufficient data is available for initial
            assessments of network structures and responses to change.
            Additionally, we have relevant network indicators for
            ecosystem management and conservation that can be weaved
            into management frameworks and monitoring programs. Starting
            now ensures that future data will be useful to detect
            network changes and to address current knowledge gaps.</p>
            <p>We recognize that the lack of empirical support for
            theory and scenarios of network responses (including
            robustness) to environmental change can refrain academics
            from providing guidance to practitioners. Robustness and
            extinction studies usually rely on simulations to
            investigate effects of species losses (rather than
            observations or experimental removals) and predictions
            remain mostly untested in the field [82; see Table 1 therein
            for some empirical validation examples]. Overcoming this
            barrier will require setting up empirical programs that go
            beyond documenting networks, and towards field and lab
            studies of network responses to realistic disturbances. Yet,
            despite this and other limitations (i.e., data, uncertainty,
            and interpretability challenges), we believe the field is
            sufficiently mature to make recommendations for ecosystem
            management and conservation as these programs are
            implemented.</p>
            <p>We envision five important aspects for future directions
            (see also Outstanding Questions). First, there should be
            developments addressing evaluation, propagation, and
            communication of uncertainty in network structure and
            metrics. It will be key to a) integrate uncertainty robustly
            into management frameworks and move towards more transparent
            and informed decisions, but also to b) use existing tools
            and data to compare known network and ecosystem changes with
            predictions (e.g. backcasting), estimate boundaries of
            future network changes (e.g. forecasting), and assess the
            usefulness of network metrics as indicators of future
            change. Second, network considerations will need to be
            explicit in future sampling and monitoring designs, and in
            ecosystem conservation regulations and decisions. Third,
            current data, network models and indicators need to be more
            widely assessed for their usefulness for ecosystem
            management, which should actively involve stakeholders.
            Fourth, empirical programs focused on testing and measuring
            network (metrics’) responses to change will need to be set
            up. Finally, incorporating network information explicitly
            into conservation will require developing network-based
            targets—specific, quantified metrics to obtain and
            thresholds to respect based on whole network
            characteristics.</p>

            <ul>
            <li>How variable is network structure across space and time
            and does it influence the usefulness of network metrics as
            indicators of ecosystem functioning and stability?</li>
            <li>What network metrics are ubiquitous, reliable and
            applicable indicators of ecosystem functioning and
            stability?</li>
            <li>How much can we expect networks to change given
            uncertainty in future environmental conditions?</li>
            <li>How can current and future monitoring programs be
            improved to sample network information relevant for
            management?</li>
            <li>How can we put in place a strong empirical program to
            validate network indicators, which for now heavily rely on
            simulations?</li>
